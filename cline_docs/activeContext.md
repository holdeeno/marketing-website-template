# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The project is currently in the active development phase. The main focuses are:

1. **Content Management with Sanity**: Working with Sanity CMS for structured content management
2. **Component Development**: Building and refining UI components based on Sanity schemas
3. **Data Integration**: Connecting frontend components with Sanity content and Supabase backend
4. **User Experience Refinement**: Ensuring responsive design and optimal user flows

## Recent Changes
The most recent developments include:

- Integration of Sanity CMS with schema definitions for main content types
- Creation of core UI components (Hero, Features, CTA, Contact, Header, Footer)
- Implementation of Sanity Studio at /studio route
- Setting up Supabase database with contact submissions table
- TypeScript type definitions for Sanity schema content

## Next Steps
The immediate next steps for the project are:

1. **Content Management Refinement**:
   - Optimize Sanity schemas based on content needs
   - Enhance Studio customization if needed
   - Add additional content types if required

2. **Frontend Optimization**:
   - Ensure responsive design works across all device sizes
   - Optimize image loading and performance
   - Refine component styling and interactions
   - Implement any missing UI elements

3. **Backend Functionality**:
   - Complete contact form submission processing
   - Finalize database structure
   - Implement any additional API endpoints
   - Test form submissions and data flow

4. **Testing & Quality Assurance**:
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Accessibility review
   - Performance optimization
   - Content management workflow testing

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Under Consideration
- **Content Preview**: Implementing draft/preview functionality for Sanity content
- **Animation Strategy**: Deciding on approach for UI animations and transitions
- **SEO Optimization**: Enhancing metadata and structured data
- **Analytics Integration**: Adding analytics tools for visitor tracking

### Recently Decided
- Use Sanity CMS for content management instead of hard-coded content
- Implement Sanity Studio directly within Next.js app at /studio route
- Structure components to match Sanity schema definitions
- Use TypeScript interfaces to ensure type safety with Sanity data

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Structure
- Component-first organization with each major section having dedicated components
- Sanity schemas organized by content type
- Shared utilities in lib directory (sanity client, image helpers, queries)
- Type definitions to match Sanity schema structure

### Naming Conventions
- PascalCase for React components
- camelCase for functions and variables
- Descriptive names for Sanity schemas that match their usage

### Development Practices
- Mobile-first responsive design
- TypeScript for type safety
- Structured content modeling in Sanity
- Component isolation for maintainability

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The combination of Next.js App Router with Sanity CMS provides a powerful headless CMS solution
- Sanity Studio integration directly in the Next.js app provides a seamless content management experience
- TypeScript interfaces for Sanity content ensures type safety across the content pipeline
- Structured content in Sanity allows for flexible presentation while maintaining content integrity
- Supabase provides an efficient backend solution for form submissions and data storage
