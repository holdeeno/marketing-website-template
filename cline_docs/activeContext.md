# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The project is currently in the initial setup and planning phase. The main focuses are:

1. **Project Structure Setup**: Establishing the foundation directory structure and configuration files
2. **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive documentation through the Memory Bank system
3. **Technical Stack Selection**: Finalizing technology choices and implementation patterns
4. **Environment Configuration**: Setting up development environment and tooling

## Recent Changes
As this is the project initialization, there are no prior changes to document. The most recent developments include:

- Creation of the Memory Bank documentation system
- Definition of the project brief and requirements
- Establishment of technical approach and architecture
- Selection of the tech stack (Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Vercel)

## Next Steps
The immediate next steps for the project are:

1. **Project Initialization**:
   - Set up Next.js with App Router
   - Configure Tailwind CSS
   - Initialize TypeScript
   - Set up linting and formatting tools

2. **Core Structure Implementation**:
   - Create basic layout components
   - Implement routing structure
   - Set up Supabase connection
   - Configure authentication foundation

3. **Development Environment**:
   - Set up local development environment
   - Configure environment variables
   - Establish connection to Supabase instance
   - Set up deployment pipeline to Vercel

4. **Initial Feature Implementation**:
   - Implement basic page structure
   - Create authentication flows
   - Set up database tables and relationships
   - Develop core UI components

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Under Consideration
- **UI Component Library**: Evaluating whether to use a pre-built component library like shadcn/ui or build custom components from scratch
- **Authentication Approach**: Deciding between Supabase Auth UI components or custom auth implementation
- **Database Schema**: Designing the initial database schema and relationships
- **Deployment Strategy**: Determining staging and production deployment workflows

### Recently Decided
- Use Next.js App Router instead of Pages Router for modern React features
- Implement TypeScript from the start for code quality and developer experience
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling to ensure consistency and rapid development
- Leverage Supabase as the backend solution for simplicity and feature set

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Structure
- Component-first organization
- Feature-based directory structure within app directory
- Shared components in a central components directory
- Utility functions organized by domain in lib directory

### Naming Conventions
- PascalCase for React components
- camelCase for functions and variables
- kebab-case for file names (except for React components)
- Descriptive, intention-revealing names

### Development Practices
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Accessibility as a core requirement
- Performance optimization from the beginning
- Regular commits with descriptive messages

## Learnings and Project Insights
As the project is just beginning, we're establishing baseline practices. Key insights so far:

- The combination of Next.js 14+ with App Router and Supabase provides a powerful, yet simple development experience
- Tailwind CSS significantly speeds up UI development while maintaining consistency
- TypeScript integration from project start prevents type-related bugs and improves documentation
- A well-structured Memory Bank documentation system ensures continuity despite context resets
