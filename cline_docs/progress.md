# Project Progress

## What Works
The project has made significant progress with the following components already implemented:

- **Documentation Structure**: Memory Bank documentation system has been established with core files:
  - Project Brief
  - Product Context
  - System Patterns
  - Technical Context
  - Active Context
  - Progress Tracking (this document)

- **Foundation**:
  - [x] Project initialization with Next.js
  - [x] TypeScript configuration
  - [x] Tailwind CSS setup
  - [x] ESLint and Prettier configuration
  - [x] Directory structure setup

- **Core Infrastructure**:
  - [x] Basic page layout and components
  - [x] Routing structure with App Router
  - [x] Component architecture
  
- **Features**:
  - [x] Public-facing page components (Header, Hero, Features, CTA, Footer)
  - [x] Responsive design implementation

## What's Left to Build

### Foundation
- [ ] Git repository initialization (if not already done)

### Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Simple contact form API implementation
- [ ] Form validation

### Features
- [ ] Additional content pages (About, Services, etc.)
- [ ] Contact form UI and functionality
- [ ] SEO optimization

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Accessibility compliance verification
- [ ] Cross-browser testing

### Deployment
- [ ] Vercel project setup
- [ ] Environment variables configuration
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline establishment
- [ ] Production deployment
- [ ] Domain configuration

## Current Status
Project is in the **Implementation Phase**, with core structure and components already in place.

### Status Summary
- **Documentation**: Updated - Core Memory Bank files aligned with marketing website focus
- **Development**: In progress - Basic structure and components implemented
- **Testing**: Not started
- **Deployment**: Not started

## Known Issues
No critical technical issues at this stage. Potential optimization areas:

- Ensuring optimal performance with Server Components and Client Components separation
- Implementing proper responsive behavior across all device sizes
- Optimizing image loading and performance
- Balancing build time optimization with runtime performance

## Evolution of Project Decisions

The project has evolved from its initial conception:

1. **Project Focus**: Shifted from a complex web application with authentication to a simpler marketing website
2. **Architectural Direction**: Maintaining Next.js App Router for a modern, performance-focused structure
3. **Backend Simplification**: Reduced backend complexity by focusing on static content with minimal form functionality
4. **Development Approach**: Building core components first with a focus on visual presentation and performance
